Question 1
Test: We are conducting an analysis of state-level data, which provides the obesity rate by state, and we are comparing this information with the state-specific cancer death rate. The objective of our study is to investigate the presence of a statistically significant correlation between the prevalence of obesity and the incidence of cancer. 
Hypothesis: Our research hypothesis is that as the obesity rate increases, there will be a corresponding rise in the cancer death rate. We expect to identify a positive correlation between these two variables. 
Null Hypothesis: Obesity has no discernible impact on the cancer death rate.

We see that the regression line equation is y = 2.96x +51.04. This indicates a positive relationship between Obesity Prevalence and Cancer Rate. So, for every one-unit increase in Obesity Prevalence, the Cancer Rate is expected to increase by 51.04 units.

We also got a P value of zero for this data which shows that we will reject out null hypothesis and accept our hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between these two variables.
